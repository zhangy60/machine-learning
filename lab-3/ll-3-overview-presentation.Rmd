# Background

- Once we've processed our variables in new ways and have made our model better, we want to select the _best possible model_
- In this learning lab, we return to the #NGSSchat data set to see how much better we can make our predictive model
- Specifically, we'll build on our use of a relatively simple model - a logistic regression - by specifying a more complex model, a random forest, though the points and process apply to any complex algorithm (i.e., support vector machine, neural network)

### Turn to an elbow partner and discuss:

- What do you think the benefits of fitting a more complex model may be?
- Which more complex models - if any - are you familiar with?
- What "costs" or downsides - if any - might accompany the estimation of a more complex model?

# How do I select a "final" or "best" model?

One general principle is to **start with the simplest useful model** and to _build toward
more complex models as helpful_.

This principle applies in multiple ways:

- To choose an algorithm, start with simpler models that you can efficiently use and understand
- To carry out feature engineering, understand your predictors well by starting with a subset
- To tune an algorithm, start with a relatively simple set of tuning parameters

This isn't just for beginners or those of us in education; [most spam filters use Support Vector Machines (and used Naive Bayes until recently)](https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/) due to their combination of effectiveness and efficiency "in production."

# The bias-variance tradeoff

- The above consideration also matters in the context of the bias-variance trade-off.

- An important way to achieve good performance with test data is to balance between the inherent _bias_ in your algorithm and the _variance_ in the predictions of your algorithm; this is referred to as the **bias-variance** trade-off of _all_ models

# The bias-variance tradeoff

.pull-left[

#### Bias

- *Definition*: Difference between our known codes/outcomes and our predicted codes/outcomes; difference between $y$ and $\hat{y}$

- How (in)correct our models' (algorithms') predictions are

- Models with high bias can fail to capture important relationships--they can be *under-fit* to our data

- In short, how well our model reflects the patterns in the data

]

.pull-right[

#### Variance

- *Definition*: Using a different sample of data, the difference in $\hat{y}$ values

- How sensitive our predictions are to the specific sample on which we trained the model 
- Models with high variance can fail to predict different data well--they can be *over-fit* to our data

- In short, how stable the predictions of our model are

<h4><center>Regardless of model, we often wish to balance between bias and variance</center></h4>

# Tuning

- Many parts of models - their _parameters_ - are estimated from the data
- Other parts cannot be estimated from the data and must be used:
    - They are often set as defaults
    - But you can often improve on these defaults
- These are _hyperparameters_ 

---

# Aside: Random forests and classification trees

- *Random forests* are extensions of classification trees
- _Classification trees_ are a type of algorithm that - at their core - use conditional logic ("if-then" statements) in a _nested_ manner
    - For instance, here's a _very, very_ simple tree (from [APM](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-6849-3)):

```{code}
if Predictor B >= 0.197 then
| if Predictor A >= 0.13 then Class = 1
| else Class = 2
else Class = 2
```

- Measures are used to determine the splits in such a way that classifies observations into small, homogeneous groups (using measures such as the Gini index and entropy measure)

---

# A more complex tree

```{code}
if Predictor B >= 0.197 then
| if Predictor A >= 0.13 then
    | if Predictor C < -1.04 then Class = 1
    | else Class = 2
else Class = 3
```

As you can imagine, with many variables, these trees can become very complex

---

# Random forests

- Random forest is an extension of decision tree modeling, whereby a collection of decision trees are simultaneously estimated ("grown") and are evaluated based on out-of-sample predictive accuracy
- Random forest estimates all the decision trees at once so each tree is independent of every other tree. 
    - The random forest algorithm provides a regression approach that is distinct from other modeling approaches. 
    - The final random forest model aggregates the findings across all the separate trees in the forest

# Tuning parameters for random forests

- There are several important tuning parameters for these models:
    - the number of predictor variables that are randomly sampled for each split in the tree (`mtry` in the code we'll run later)
    - the number of data points required to execute a split (`min_n`)
    - the minimum number of observations in each node (`size`)
- These tuning parameters, broadly, balance predictive performance with the training data with how well the model will perform on new data
